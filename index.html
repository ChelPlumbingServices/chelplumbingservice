            <div class="service-card" data-details="Plumbing is the system of pipes and fixtures that brings clean water into your home and removes waste water. Signs of plumbing problems include drains making gurgling or bubbling sounds, water draining slowly from sinks, bathtubs, or showers, and faucets or pipes having visible leaks. You might notice unusually low water pressure, toilets that frequently clog or overflow, or unpleasant odors coming from drains or pipes. Other signs include water stains or damp spots on walls or ceilings, unexplained increases in your water bill, puddles of water around your home without rain, or rust or discoloration in your water.">

                <h3>Plumbing</h3>
                <p>From leak repairs to pipe installations, we provide expert plumbing solutions for any need.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card" data-details="Siphoning is the process of removing liquid from one place to another using a tube, typically through a process of gravity. It works by creating a difference in height between two containers, allowing the liquid to flow from the higher container to the lower one. Signs that you may need siphoning services include slow or clogged drains, foul odors coming from the drainage system, or when waste materials are not draining properly, which can lead to backups or flooding. If water is not draining as it should or there are blockages in your septic or drainage systems, siphoning can help remove excess waste and prevent further damage.">
                <h3>Siphoning</h3>
                <p>Fast and efficient siphoning for septic tanks, ensuring a clean and healthy environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card" data-details="Declogging is the process of clearing blockages from pipes or drains to restore proper flow. Signs that you need declogging services include slow drainage in sinks, showers, or bathtubs, water backing up into drains, or unpleasant smells coming from drains. If you notice gurgling sounds when water drains, standing water in sinks or tubs, or frequent toilet clogs, it’s likely time for a declogging service. Ignoring these issues can lead to more severe plumbing problems, including pipe damage or water overflow.">
                <h3>Declogging</h3>
                <p>Say goodbye to clogs with our reliable and professional declogging services for pipes and drains.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-card" data-details="Manual cleaning is the process of physically removing blockages, debris, or waste from pipes or drainage systems. Signs that manual cleaning may be needed include slow drainage, standing water in sinks, tubs, or showers, or foul odors coming from the drain. If a drain is completely clogged and chemical cleaners or plunger attempts are ineffective, manual cleaning can help clear the obstruction. This method is often necessary when dealing with stubborn clogs, grease buildup, or foreign objects stuck in the pipes.">
                <h3>Manual Cleaning</h3>
                <p>We provide manual cleaning for plumbing systems to maintain peak performance and avoid future issues.</p>
